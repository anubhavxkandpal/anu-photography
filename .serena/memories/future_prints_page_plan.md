# Future Prints Page Implementation Plan

## Page Structure
- **Hero Section**: "Fine Art Prints" with featured print image showcase
- **Print Categories**: Landscape prints, Portrait prints, Artistic prints (grid layout)
- **Print Options**: 
  - Sizes: 8x10, 11x14, 16x20, 24x36
  - Materials: Canvas, Metal, Paper, Acrylic
- **Pricing Table**: Simple grid showing size/material combinations with pricing
- **Featured Prints**: Curated selection of best-selling images
- **Ordering Process**: How ordering works, shipping info, framing options
- **Quality Promise**: Print quality guarantee, materials description

## Key Features to Implement
- Filter prints by category and size
- Print preview tool showing different size options
- Add to cart functionality (or individual contact forms per print)
- Shipping calculator based on location
- Sample print request option for quality verification

## Technical Integration
- Integrate with existing gallery images but focus on print-ready versions
- Could start with simple contact forms per print
- Later upgrade to full e-commerce with Stripe/PayPal
- Use existing image optimization pipeline
- Maintain consistent design language with current site

## Implementation Priority
- Start simple with contact-based ordering
- Add pricing and size information
- Gradually build toward full e-commerce functionality
- Consider print-on-demand integration (Printful, etc.)

This would be a natural next phase after the core portfolio is complete.
