## Completed Improvements:

### 1. **Lightbox White Frame** ✅
- Added elegant white frame around photos in the lightbox
- Creates better visual separation from dark green background

### 2. **Masonry Gallery with Better Spacing** ✅
- Updated MasonryGallery component with:
  - Maximum 3 columns (instead of 4) for better negative space
  - Increased gaps between images: `gap-8 lg:gap-12`
  - Larger container padding: `px-8 lg:px-12 py-16`
  - More dramatic hover effect: `scale-110` with longer duration
  - Title overlay commented out until proper titles are added
  - Max width container for consistent layout

### 3. **Hero Slideshow Improvements** ✅
- Updated hero images selection:
  - Removed poor quality image 3
  - Added Kalga mountain images
  - Added bridge architectural photo
  - Added water body landscape
  - Better mix of landscapes and artistic photos
- 6-second auto-rotation with smooth transitions

### 4. **Gallery Pages Migration**
- landscapes.astro - ✅ Updated to use MasonryGallery
- portraits.astro - ✅ Updated to use MasonryGallery  
- artsy.astro - Needs manual update (see migration helper)
- events.astro - Needs manual update (see migration helper)

## Manual Updates Needed:
For artsy.astro and events.astro, replace:
1. Line 3: `AnimatedGallery` → `MasonryGallery` in import
2. Component usage: `<AnimatedGallery` → `<MasonryGallery`

## Design Decisions:
- 3 column max for better visual breathing room
- Larger gaps create gallery-like presentation
- Hover effects kept subtle but engaging
- Title overlays hidden until proper titles added
